# Implementation Plan: Upgrade Data Grid with Filter Sidebar

**Branch**: `001-upgrade-data-grid` | **Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Spec**: /Users/akme/Coding/stake-machine/indexer-agent-ui/specs/001-upgrade-data-grid/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-upgrade-data-grid/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (n/a currently)
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Upgrade existing `DataGrid` component to support a toggleable filter sidebar that enables users to apply multi-field, persistent filters across tabular data while preserving state when hidden. Emphasis on improved UX for complex filtering without crowding table headers.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Next.js 15, React 19)  
**Primary Dependencies**: `@tanstack/react-table`, existing UI library (Radix-based components), Zustand store (potential), internal `DataGrid`  
**Storage**: N/A (client-side state + remote fetched data)  
**Testing**: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`  
**Target Platform**: Web (Next.js app router)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend only for this feature)  
**Performance Goals**: Filter apply interaction <150ms perceived; no significant layout shift; minimal re-renders  
**Constraints**: Must not break current DataGrid usage sites; Sidebar must be optionally rendered; Accessible keyboard + screen reader support  
**Scale/Scope**: Tables up to ~5k rows client-side (current usage) with future server-side filtering extensibility  

Unresolved / Needs Clarification from spec:  
- Sidebar behavior on mobile (overlay vs push content)  
- Initial default filter set per table context  
- Persistence scope (session, per-page, per-table key?)  

## Constitution Check
**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (frontend web app) ✔
- Using framework directly: Yes (Next + react-table) ✔
- Single data model: Yes (augment existing in-component state) ✔
- Avoiding patterns: No extra abstraction layers planned ✔

**Architecture**:
- Libraries: Not introducing new library packages ✔
- CLI: Not applicable (UI feature) ✔
- Library docs: N/A for this frontend-only enhancement

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- Will add failing tests first for: toggle visibility, applying filters, state persistence, clearing filters ✔ (planned)
- Integration style via component tests (Testing Library) ✔
- No mocks beyond lightweight data fixtures ✔

**Observability**:
- Can add console.warn for unexpected filter config (optional)  
- Not introducing logging pipeline changes

**Versioning**:
- Minor feature in 0.3.x line; no breaking API if props added backward-compatible  
- Add new props with sane defaults

Result: Initial Constitution Check: PASS

## Project Structure
Using existing component structure under `components/`. No new top-level folders. Artifacts under `specs/001-upgrade-data-grid/` per lifecycle.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) retained.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Planned research topics:
1. Filter state persistence patterns for react-table (columnFilters vs custom)  
2. Accessibility patterns for toggleable complementary sidebar (ARIA roles)  
3. Performance: Debounced vs immediate filter application for large sets  
4. Responsive strategy for sidebar (overlay vs drawer) → NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
5. Schema-driven filter control generation (infer control from column meta)

research.md will document: choices (e.g., store filters in react-table state + external memo), rationale, and alternatives (URL query sync vs local state; overlay vs push layout).

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Planned outputs:
- data-model.md: Define FilterDescriptor (id, type, operator set, value shape), FilterGroup (AND composition), persistence key scheme.
- contracts/: Define pseudo-contract for filter config shape consumed by DataGrid (TypeScript interface documented, not runtime API).
- quickstart.md: Steps to enable sidebar on existing table.
- Failing tests:  
  - Renders toggle button and reveals sidebar  
  - Applies text filter updates visible rows  
  - Multiple filters combine (AND)  
  - Hiding + reopening preserves state  
  - Clearing filters resets rows

Post-Design Constitution Check: anticipate PASS (no complexity escalation).

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
Will generate tasks mapping FRs to test-first steps:  
Ordering:
1. Add tests for feature flags/props.  
2. Implement minimal prop surface (sidebar toggle).  
3. Add filter registry + control rendering.  
4. Persistence/state restore.  
5. Responsive/mobile adaptation.  
6. Final accessibility and docs.

Parallelizable tasks marked for independent test files: filter logic unit tests, UI toggle interaction, persistence layer.

Estimated tasks: 18-24.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
Out of scope for /plan; executed after tasks generation.
