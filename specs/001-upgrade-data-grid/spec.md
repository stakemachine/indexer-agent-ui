# Feature Specification: Upgrade Data Grid with Filter Sidebar

**Feature Branch**: `001-upgrade-data-grid`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Need to upgrade current data-grid component that will have filters in a kind of a sidebar that could be used for filtering across table data, can be easily hidden"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user viewing a data grid, I want to be able to open a sidebar with filter options, so that I can easily narrow down the data in the table to find what I'm looking for. I also want to be able to hide the sidebar to maximize the view of the data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I am viewing a data grid, **When** I click a "Filters" button, **Then** a sidebar appears with filter controls.
2.  **Given** the filter sidebar is open, **When** I apply a filter (e.g., select a value from a dropdown), **Then** the data in the grid updates to reflect the filter.
3.  **Given** the filter sidebar is open, **When** I click a "close" or "hide" button, **Then** the sidebar disappears.
4.  **Given** a filter is active and the sidebar is closed, **When** I reopen the sidebar, **Then** my previously selected filter values are still active.

### Edge Cases
-   What happens if the data grid has no data? The filter sidebar should still be functional but may have disabled or empty filter options.
-   How does the layout respond on smaller screens? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should the filter sidebar behave on mobile or small-screen devices? Should it overlay the content or push it?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
-   **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a mechanism (e.g., a button) to toggle the visibility of a filter sidebar on the data grid component.
-   **FR-002**: The filter sidebar MUST contain controls that allow users to filter the data displayed in the grid.
-   **FR-003**: The data grid MUST dynamically update its content based on the selected filters.
-   **FR-004**: The state of the filters MUST be preserved when the sidebar is hidden and shown again.
-   **FR-005**: The specific filter controls will be determined by the data source of each grid. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the initial filterable columns/attributes for the existing data grids?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
-   **Data Grid**: Represents the tabular data display.
-   **Filter Set**: Represents the collection of active filters applied to the grid.
